        <h1>Datasets & Methodoly</h1>
        <h3>Datasets</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset used for this analysis consists of smart meter readings from London households spanning from November 2011 to February 2014, totaling 5,567 households and 3,510,433 observations. It includes nine features providing insightful information on energy consumption patterns. Key features include House_ID for tracking households, Date for temporal analysis, Energy_Mean for average consumption, and Energy_Sum for total consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dataset also incorporates household information like stdorTou indicating tariff type (standard or time-of-use), Acorn for demographic segmentation, and Category for home type classification. Additionally, weather and holiday data from the Dark Sky API enrich the analysis. Holiday data includes Holiday_Type and Holiday_Date, while weather data offers insights like Temperature_Max and Cloud cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          These additional datasets enhance the understanding of energy consumption patterns by accounting for seasonal fluctuations and external factors like holidays and weather conditions. The aim is to create more accurate predictive models and provide insights for energy-saving initiatives and sustainable energy management.
        </p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>
          This paper utilizes a systematic approach combining preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, clustering analysis, and predictive modeling algorithms to analyze and predict energy usage patterns in London households.

        <h4>Preprocessing</h4>
The data undergoes preprocessing to ensure quality and suitability for analysis. This involves merging datasets, handling missing values, and imputing data using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
        <p>
        <h4>Feature Selection</h4> 

        <p>ANOVA is used to identify if categorical variables significantly affect a continuous outcome, with a focus on variance between and within groups. A low p-value indicates a potentially important feature. Pearson Correlation assesses the linear relationship between quantitative variables. Correlations near 1 or -1 signify strong relationships, which could mean redundancy among features.</p>
<p>Interpreting correlations requires context. For instance, in the UK, low air conditioning usage despite high temperatures can be explained by cultural habits and architectural design optimized for heat retention. Similarly, the UK's temperate climate and cloud cover result in lower dew points and UV index values, contrary to what might be expected in other geographic locations. Understanding these subtleties is key to meaningful feature selection and model construction.</p>
         <h4>Clustering Analysis</h4> 
        <p>user segmentation involves dividing a customer base into groups based on shared characteristics like age, gender, or spending habits, allowing for tailored marketing strategies. The study used Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) for segmentation, handling multiple categorical variables. Key variables included energy consumption metrics and the Acorn classification, a UK-specific categorization reflecting demographics and lifestyle. The analysis yielded clusters with distinct energy usage patterns and socioeconomic statuses. For instance, one cluster with high energy consumption was associated with affluent achievers, another with lower consumption corresponded to financially stretched communities, and a third was tied to comfortable communities but facing certain difficulties. This segmentation aids in understanding customer behavior and developing targeted marketing approaches.</p>

          <img src="style/Picture2.png" alt="example graphic" />
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Cluster profiling </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Clusters (0, 1, 2): Individuals or households are segmented into three clusters, which are differentiated by similar patterns of energy consumption and socio-economic backgrounds. This suggests strategic data analysis to identify and categorize comparable units within the dataset.</li>
          <li>Energy Consumption: 
            <ul>
              <li>Cluster 0: The highest average energy consumption at 16.61 kWh, indicating that members likely live in colder climates, larger homes, or have energy-intensive lifestyles.</li>
              <li>Cluster 1: The lowest energy consumption at 9.06 kWh, which might reflect energy-saving habits or smaller household sizes.</li>
              <li>Cluster 2: Moderate energy usage at 10.51 kWh, possibly reflecting average household conditions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>StdorToU: All clusters are on a standard ('Std') energy tariff, indicating no differentiation in tariff type across the clusters.
          </li>
          <li>Acorn Categories:
            <ul>
              <li>Cluster 0: Categorized under 'E - Career Climbers', aligning with affluent achievers who have higher energy needs.</li>
              <li>Cluster 1: Labeled 'F - Countryside Communities', and falling under 'Category 4 - Financially Stretched', suggesting limited financial resources impact their energy consumption.</li>
              <li>Cluster 2: Identified as 'Q - Difficult Circumstances' but falls under 'Category 3 - Comfortable Communities', indicating a complex socio-economic positioning with both comforts and challenges.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>These insights help in understanding the diverse energy consumption patterns and socio-economic contexts of each cluster, allowing for tailored strategies in energy management and community support initiatives. </p>
        <h4>Predictive Modeling</h4> 
        <p>The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables (ARIMAX) technique was used for predictive modeling for each user type. ARIMAX incorporates external factors like weather and holiday data to accurately forecast future energy demand by considering both autoregressive and moving average components.</p>
        <h5>For Cluster 0</h5>
        <p>The ARIMAX model used in cluster analysis for Cluster 0 incorporates exogenous variables like 'weather' and 'Holiday' to predict future values based on historical data. The evaluation of the model involves detailed diagnostic plots to assess its residuals and overall fit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standardized Residuals Plot: Shows residuals distributed over time without any apparent trend, indicating effective data capture by the model.</li>
          <li>Density Plot and Histogram Estimated: Reveals that residuals are nearly normally distributed with some minor deviations, indicating a close fit to the expected normal distribution.</li>
          <li>Normal Q-Q Plot: Points out slight deviations from normality at the distribution's tails, suggesting the presence of outliers or heavy tails.</li>
          <li>Correlogram (ACF Plot): Demonstrates minimal autocorrelation among residuals, confirming the model's efficiency in capturing time-dependent data structures.</li>
        </ul>

          <img src="style/Picture3.png" alt="example graphic" />
          <img src="style/Picture4.png" alt="example graphic" />
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <h5>For Cluster 1</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Statistical Significance: The log transformation used in the model achieved a highly significant p-value (1.5e-20), indicating strong statistical evidence that this transformation improved the model's adherence to the assumptions necessary for valid inference.
            </li>
          <li>Residuals Analysis: Diagnostic plots show that residuals generally exhibit no autocorrelation or non-constant variance, suggesting the model is well-specified for this cluster. However, there are indications of slight deviations in the residuals’ normality, particularly at the tails as observed in the Q-Q plot. This points to the presence of outliers or extreme values that do not conform perfectly to a normal distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="style/Picture5.png" alt="example graphic" />
          <img src="style/Picture6.png" alt="example graphic" />
        </div>
        <h5>For Cluster 2</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Statistical Significance: A p-value of 0.0 in the diagnostics suggests an extremely significant result, indicating strong evidence that the model's parameters are significantly different from zero and thus meaningfully contributing to predicting the response variable. This statistically significant result implies a high confidence in the model's fit.
            </li>
          <li>Residual Analysis: Diagnostic plots suggest that there are no substantial patterns of autocorrelation or non-random structure in the residuals, indicating a well-fitted model. However, minor deviations from normality are noted, particularly in the tails of the Q-Q plot, highlighting potential outliers or extremities in the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="style/Picture7.png" alt="example graphic" />
          <img src="style/Picture8.png" alt="example graphic" />
